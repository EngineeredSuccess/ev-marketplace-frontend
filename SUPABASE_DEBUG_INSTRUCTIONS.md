# Supabase Debug Instructions

## 🔍 Debug Component Added

I've temporarily added a debug component to your website that will show the current environment variable status.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the current code** to Vercel (with the debug component)
2. **Visit https://www.ivimarket.pl** 
3. **Look for a white debug box** in the top-right corner
4. **Take a screenshot** of the debug info and share it

## 🎯 What the Debug Will Show

The debug component will display:
```json
{
  "supabaseUrl": "https://nhzalkqwpwcnnggrpqyo.supabase.co" (or null),
  "supabaseKey": "Present" (or "Missing"),
  "origin": "https://www.ivimarket.pl",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T..."
}
```

## 🔧 Expected Results

### If Environment Variables Are Correct:
```json
{
  "supabaseUrl": "https://nhzalkqwpwcnnggrpqyo.supabase.co",
  "supabaseKey": "Present",
  "origin": "https://www.ivimarket.pl"
}
```
**→ Then the issue is in Supabase OAuth configuration**

### If Environment Variables Are Missing:
```json
{
  "supabaseUrl": null,
  "supabaseKey": "Missing",
  "origin": "https://www.ivimarket.pl"
}
```
**→ Then environment variables need to be set in Vercel**

## 🚨 Current Issue Analysis

Since you're getting "Supabase not configured" error, it means:
1. Either environment variables are missing in Vercel
2. Or the Supabase OAuth provider is not properly configured
3. Or there's a mismatch between Google Cloud Console and Supabase settings

## 📸 What I Need

Please:
1. Deploy this version with the debug component
2. Visit the website
3. Take a screenshot of the debug info box
4. Share the screenshot so I can see exactly what's happening

This will help me identify whether it's:
- ❌ Environment variable issue (Vercel configuration)
- ❌ Supabase OAuth provider configuration issue
- ❌ Google Cloud Console / Supabase credential mismatch

## 🔄 After Debugging

Once we identify the issue, I'll:
1. Fix the root cause
2. Remove the debug component
3. Test the OAuth flow

The debug component is temporary and will be removed once we solve the issue.

# CRITICAL: Supabase Site URL Protocol Mismatch Fix

## 🚨 ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: Supabase Site URL is set to `http://www.ivimarket.pl` but your website uses `https://www.ivimarket.pl`

This protocol mismatch (HTTP vs HTTPS) is causing the OAuth authentication to fail.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Fix Site URL in Supabase
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nhzalkqwpwcnnggrpqyo/auth/url-configuration
2. Change **Site URL** from:
   ```
   ❌ http://www.ivimarket.pl
   ```
   To:
   ```
   ✅ https://www.ivimarket.pl
   ```
3. Click **Save changes**

### Step 2: Verify Redirect URLs
Make sure your redirect URLs are also HTTPS:
- ✅ `https://www.ivimarket.pl/**`
- ✅ `https://www.ivimarket.pl/auth/callback`

## 🎯 Why This Matters

When you click "Kontynuuj z Google":
1. Your HTTPS site (`https://www.ivimarket.pl`) initiates OAuth
2. Google authenticates the user
3. Google tries to redirect back via Supabase
4. Supabase tries to redirect to HTTP site (`http://www.ivimarket.pl`)
5. **This fails** because of protocol mismatch
6. You get "Supabase not configured" error

## ✅ Expected Result After Fix

After changing to HTTPS:
1. Click "Kontynuuj z Google" ✅
2. Redirects to Google login ✅
3. Google authenticates user ✅
4. Supabase redirects to HTTPS site ✅
5. User is logged in ✅

## 🔍 Current Configuration Status

From your screenshots, I can see:
- ✅ **Google Cloud Console**: Correctly configured with both redirect URIs
- ✅ **Supabase OAuth Provider**: Google is enabled with correct Client ID
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Working (debug shows "Present")
- ❌ **Site URL Protocol**: HTTP instead of HTTPS

## 📋 This Should Be The Final Fix

Everything else is correctly configured. This HTTP/HTTPS mismatch is the last remaining issue preventing Google OAuth from working.

**Change the Site URL to HTTPS and the OAuth should work immediately!**
